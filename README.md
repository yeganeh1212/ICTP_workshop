# Visualizing Protein Residue Modifications <a><img src='images/img.jpg' align="right" height="138.5" /></a>

This is project is about getting insight from the protein data using visualization. We thank our client [Laura Garrison](https://vis.uib.no/team/laura-garrison/) for trusting us with their data.

## The dataset

The protein dataset consists of `9` columns and `8,354` rows. The following are the attributes of the data:

**UniAcc**: Protein ID in UniProt database (this is just a unique identifier for the protein for a given species, e.g., human).

**RES**: Amino acid residues - there are `20` different amino acids, each have a unique single letter ID.

**POS**: The location ID of a given residue in a given protein. 

**MOD**: Specific modification that is occurring at that site. 

**Entry**: Similar to UniAcc except more human-readable, identifies the gene+species of protein together as one string.

**Gene**: Name of gene that encodes the resulting protein.

**Species**: Species that protein comes from, e.g., human, mouse.

**Classification**: High-level classification of the type of modification that is occurring at the site. This is a more coarse-grained classification relative to MOD attribute.

**PathogenicMutation**: Boolean. If True, means that this site is associated with a disease.
